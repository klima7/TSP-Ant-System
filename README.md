# TSP Ant System
**Ant System** algorithm solving **Traveling Salesman Problem**, where cities are located in 3D space.

Two versions are considered:
- Symmetric - cost of traveling between two cities is equal to euclidean distance.
- Assymetric - like in symmetric versions, but 10% of cost is added or subtracted according to whether he travels uphill or downhill.
